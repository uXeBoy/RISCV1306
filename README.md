# RISCV1306

I've stitched together the PicoRV32 RISC-V core with my VGA1306 FPGA code, and the experimental result is the RISC-V core running a (also stitched together) version of the Adafruit SSD1306 demo sketch that outputs directly to the VGA1306 OLED emulation - all self-contained within the FPGA!
